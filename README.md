# Library_System

This project is a practical application of everything I have learned in C++ .

This is a project for organizing data in the library by adding books, and it can also organize users for the library, and there is also a feature to borrow and return the book. But this program does not create a local database, its use is only when the program is running. It does not have a user interface .
## Features:
### 1 - Adding Book
#### In the first choice, you can add a book by specifying the name, the book's identification number, and the number to be added from this book.
### 2 - Adding User
#### In the second choice, you can add a user in library by  adding his/her name, the user's identification number.
