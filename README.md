# Library_System

This project is a practical application of everything I have learned in C++ .

This is a project for organizing data in the library by adding books, and it can also organize users for the library, and there is also a feature to borrow and return the book. But this program does not create a local database, its use is only when the program is running. It does not have a user interface .
